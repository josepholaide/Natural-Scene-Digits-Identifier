# Natural Scene Digits Classfication
In this project, the SVHN dataset was used. This is an image dataset of over 600,000 digit images in all, and is a harder dataset than MNIST as the numbers appear in the context of natural scene images. SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end workflow for building, training, validating, evaluating and saving a neural network that classifies a real-world image into one of ten classes.

The model developed was deployed using FastAPI and Docker.

Tools:

1. Tensorflow
2. Docker
3. FastAPI
4. OpenCV
